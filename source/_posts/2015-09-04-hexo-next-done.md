I think the hexo + next theme configuration should be almost done.

It takes 2 days for all the configuration and I have to say that this should be quick enough for a self build static blog.

Enable most of the feature for Next theme, which is really a good theme.

For all the configuration and environment, please refer to the [hexo-content](https://github.com/winterTTr/winterTTr.github.io/tree/hexo-content) branch of the [my github](https://github.com/winterTTr).
